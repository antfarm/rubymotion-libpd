rubymotion-libpd
================

A skeleton RubyMotion [1] app that interacts with a Pure Data [2] patch [3] using pd-for-ios [4] and libpd [5].

To install libpd for iOS, execute ./bin/install_libpd.sh.
Then run rake to build the app.

As an introductory text to libpd read [6]. For in-depth knowledge of Pure Data and sound design read [7] and [8]. MacRuby, on which RubyMotion is based, is described in great detail in [9] and [10].
